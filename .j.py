Here is the modified code with exception handling:

```python
import smtplib, csv, random
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

# Zoho Mail SMTP server details
try:
    with open("mails.csv", "r") as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        rows = list(reader)
        rows = rows[1:]
    if rows:
        with open("mails.csv", "w", newline='') as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerows(rows)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", str(e))

smtp_server = 'smtp.zoho.com'
port = 587  # or 465 for SSL
username = 'getit32'
password = 'qaz1wsx2.'
with open('emails/message1.txt', 'r') as l:
    msg = l.read()
with open('mails.csv', 'r') as mail:
    try:
        k = csv.reader(mail)
        l = list(k)
        for i in l:
            p = i
            print(p)
            # Email details
            sender_email = 'getit32@zohomail.com'
            receiver_email = p
            subject = 'Test Email'
            body = msg

            for receiver in receiver_email:
                try:
                    print(receiver)
                    # Create message
                    message = MIMEMultipart()
                    message['From'] = sender_email
                    message['To'] = receiver
                    message['Subject'] = subject
                    message.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
                    print(receiver)

                    # Connect to the server
                    with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, port) as server:
                        server.starttls()  # Secure the connection
                        server.login(username, password)
                        server.send_message(message)

                    print('Email sent successfully!')
                except smtplib.SMTPException:
                    print('Failed to send email')
    except csv.Error as e:
        print('CSV Error occurred:', str(e))
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred:", str(e))
```

In this modified code, I have added try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions that may occur during file operations, email sending, and CSV related operations. These exceptions include `FileNotFoundError`, `Exception`, `smtplib.SMTPException`, and `csv.Error`. The code now provides appropriate error messages when any of these exceptions occur.
